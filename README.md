# Ray-Casting-Exploration
Me trying to write my own ray casting algorithm

Hello, this is a project where I explore the use of a Ray-Casting Algorithm to render a 3d sphere.

I have no formal training in 3d graphics and simply read the wikipedia page about this stuff.

This algorithm was not copied from anywhere nor should you use it, it's probably super inneficient.

Here's a sphere I rendered with it:
